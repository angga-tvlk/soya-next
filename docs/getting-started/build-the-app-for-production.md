# Build the App for Production

You have learned and finished creating your first React app in Soya Next.
The next step is to build the app to optimize and hash the bundles for the best performance.

To build your app, run the following:

```bash
npm run build
```

It will build a minified version of your app into `.next` directory.

You are ready to deploy your app to production now.
